* TODO [50%]
- [X] If there is a item copied that contians any special chars such as `\n \t
  \r` and so on remove them as it doesn't play well when getting the time back
  out with programs like dmenu or fzf
- [ ] Allow clipboard script to pass in `-f -d -r` for fzf, dmenu, or rofi
  - Use the $2 for which picker and $1 for the option
  - Also maybe set a defualt as a ENV varible and if there is no option
    sellected then use dmenu
