#+title: README
- This only works on linux right now
- Macos support comming soon
- Windows support never, as fuck you windows users

* What is this?
This is just a simple golang cli that you can use fuzzy finders with to get your clipboard history.
Only issue is right now I'm not sure how to have this listening in the
background for cilpboard changes and add it, and I also don't want to take up to
much cpu or ram. So right now you have to muanllly add items.
* Install
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/skykosiner/find-me-daddy
cd find-me-daddy
chmod +x ./build
./build
#+end_src
* Usage
** Adding items
#+begin_src bash
find-me-daddy -add
#+end_src
This will add whatever is on your clipboard to the clipboard.json file, that can
be found `~/.local/share/clipboard.json`
** Searching items with a fuzzy finder
By defualt if you call `find-me-daddy -get-fuzzy` it will just use dmenu. But
sometimes you might want rofi, or fzf. You can eaither pass in options such as
#+begin_src bash
# Dmenu
find-me-daddy -get-fuzzy -d

# Rofi
find-me-daddy -get-fuzzy -r

# Fzf
find-me-daddy -get-fuzzy -f
#+end_src

or if you want to use rofi every time you can set the envoriment varible
FIND_ME_DADDY_FUZZY to rofi command that needs to brun such as `rofi -dmenu`.
And you could really put any command that taken in std in and returns std out
after you select an item.
** Return list of items to std out
Sometimes you just want to return a list of items to std out to manpulate the list and do things with item
#+begin_src bash
find-me-daddy -get-list
#+end_src
* TODO [100%]
- [X] If there is a item copied that contians any special chars such as `\n \t
  \r` and so on remove them as it doesn't play well when getting the time back
  out with programs like dmenu or fzf
- [X] Allow clipboard script to pass in `-f -d -r` for fzf, dmenu, or rofi
  - Use the $2 for which picker and $1 for the option
  - Also maybe set a defualt as a ENV varible and if there is no option
    sellected then use dmenu
